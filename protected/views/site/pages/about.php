<h1>About</h1>

<p>Nowadays students that seek answers for school related questions usually use search engines as their main source of information;</br>
    but in most cases this information is unreliable and incomplete. This project was envisioned to fulfill this need; to allow</br>
    students to communicate with mentors that are experts in their field. In our mentoring platform students can post a question of</br>
    any subject and it will be assigned to the most expertise domain mentor to get the most reliable and accurate answer. In senior</br>
    project class, these platforms could be use for communication within team members and their mentors.</br></p>
